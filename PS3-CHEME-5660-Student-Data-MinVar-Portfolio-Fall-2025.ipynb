    "In this problem set, we'll compute the [Efficient Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier) for a portfolio of risky assets, where the expected return and the covariance of the returns are calculated from a historical dataset. You will then simulate the performance of the minimum-variance portfolio on out-of-sample data.\n",

    "> __Learning Objectives:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> By the end of this example, you will be able to:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **Compute empirical portfolio statistics from historical data and formulate Markowitz optimization problems.** Extract expected returns and covariance matrices from market data, then set up constrained quadratic optimization problems that minimize portfolio risk for given return targets using the classical mean-variance framework to find optimal asset allocations.\n",
    "> * **Generate and analyze efficient frontier curves for risky asset portfolios.** Systematically compute optimal portfolios across different risk-return combinations and visualize the resulting efficient frontier to understand the trade-offs between expected return and portfolio volatility in the context of diversification benefits.\n",
    "> * **Simulate portfolio performance using multi-asset stochastic models.** Implement geometric Brownian motion simulations to generate sample price trajectories for multiple correlated assets, enabling out-of-sample testing of minimum-variance portfolios against market benchmarks and evaluation of strategy robustness under uncertainty.\n",

We know that $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^{\\top} = \\Sigma$, so let's compare `Σ̂ᵣ` and the matrix product $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^{\\top}$ using the [@assert macro](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Base.@assert) in combination with the [isapprox function](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/math/#Base.isapprox) with `rtol = 1e-6` (or you can choose some other random small value).\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this example, we implemented a complete data-driven approach to modern portfolio theory, computing the efficient frontier for a portfolio of risky assets using historical market data and evaluating performance through simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> * **Historical data provides empirical inputs for portfolio optimization, but with important limitations.** By computing sample means and covariance matrices from real price data, we obtain the statistical parameters needed for Markowitz optimization, though these estimates reflect past relationships that may not persist in the future—making out-of-sample testing crucial for validation.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Markowitz optimization systematically balances expected return against portfolio risk.** The minimum-variance framework estimates optimal asset allocations that minimize portfolio variance for each target return level, and by plotting these optimal portfolios across different return targets, we visualize the efficient frontier—the boundary of achievable risk-return combinations showing how diversification can reduce risk without sacrificing expected return.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Stochastic simulation enables robust testing of portfolio strategies under uncertainty.** Multi-asset geometric Brownian motion models generate correlated price trajectories that capture realistic market dynamics, allowing us to evaluate how minimum-variance portfolios perform on out-of-sample data compared to benchmarks like index funds, revealing the practical implications of optimization-based allocation decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework demonstrates how quantitative methods can guide portfolio construction decisions, though real-world implementation requires careful consideration of parameter estimation uncertainty, changing market conditions, and many other factors. But it is a start!\n",
